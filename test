We are dedicated to great quality products and awesome customer care, we are continually evolving our designs, offerings and support. Our mission is always to provide the best quality and keep our customers happy and alway coming back.




For 50 years Anglian has been at the forefront of the nation’s home improvements industry.

Right from the start in 1966, a commitment to quality and genuine customer care has been at the heart of Anglian's philosophy. We, very quickly, established a reputation for the quality of our windows, opening our first showroom in Ipswich in 1969 to showcase our unique and contemporary designs.

We've grown massively as a company since then, opening more showrooms across the whole country and new factories where our windows, doors, conservatories and other products are made. However, our mission is still the same – to provide exceptional quality and value so that our customers will come back to us time and time again. Find out why so many customers choose and recommend Anglian.

Caring for the environment

At Anglian, we’re sincere about our passion for the environment and make huge efforts to protect it. For example, each year we recycle 3,300 tonnes of glass, 1,300 tonnes of PVC, 80 tonnes of metal and 270 tonnes of wood. We introduced our Scrappage Scheme to help in recycling waste materials. The scheme enables customers to receive up to £3,000 when they purchase new energy-efficient windows from us because we are able to recycle their old windows.
